The project is unique\r\n        because it delivers a method to simulate the impact of different\r\n        measures on the spread of COVID-19 in a large number of countries around\r\n        the world. The tool works by using machine learning techniques to\r\n        analyse public data and deliver hypothetical projections of how\r\n        different isolation measures will impact the spread of COVID-19. The\r\n        intention is to make it possible for experts and intersted people around\r\n        the world to analyse how diverse exit strategies will impact the spread\r\n        of coronavirus in a six-month timeframe. Four different activity areas\r\n        are given as variables: workplaces, outdoor activities, public\r\n        transportation, and retail. The tool uses data that is publicly\r\n        available, from the Google COVID-19 dataset, to create its predictions.\r\n        A user is able to understand how policies related to each activity\r\n        impact the spread of the disease by selecting a country and changing the\r\n        value that represents the intensity of any given isolation measure. Le\r\n        Traon brought together two teams at SnT to collaborate on this project.\r\n        The researchers are releasing a beta version of the instrument for two\r\n        reasons. First, in order to provide this tool as fast as possible for\r\n        the benefit of the public. Second, as with any beta version, they have\r\n        arrived at the point in the development process requires the feedback of\r\n        users in order to refine the machine-learning algorithm fueling it.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The simulator is a living project, as such it is updated gradually by\r\n        the interdisciplinary team as they progress in their research. In the\r\n        future, scientists plan to look at adding customisation features based\r\n        on datasets stemming from the World Health Organisation (WHO) such as\r\n        wearing masks and testing strategies.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </Content>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
